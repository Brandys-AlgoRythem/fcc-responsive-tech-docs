                <header>Journey to Employment</header>
                <p>Transitioning into the tech field, especially after a career break, involves several factors influencing the time to secure a first role. Employers' perceptions of career breaks are evolving, but it's beneficial to address any gaps proactively. </p>
                <p>Framing time spent as a stay-at-home parent and managing an online business as periods of skill development (time management, project management, customer interaction) is crucial. New certifications are strong positives but must be complemented by a portfolio. </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Strategic_Recommendations">
                <header>Strategic Recommendations</header>
                <p>Given the specific background and location in Americus, Georgia, certain strategies are recommended. Due to Americus having a smaller local tech market, the primary focus should be on remote job opportunities. </p>
                <p>Utilize job board filters for "remote" and "Georgia". While remote roles are key, also explore local and regional possibilities, even contract or freelance work initially. </p>
                <p>Crafting a compelling narrative is essential. Use a skills-based or combination resume format. Explicitly list roles like "Online Business Owner/Manager" and detail transferable skills like project management and digital marketing. </p>
                <p>In your cover letter, articulate your motivation for transitioning to tech and how your unique experiences are an asset. For interviews, practice explaining your career break positively and develop a concise "elevator pitch". </p>
                <p><code>// Emphasize transferable skills</code>. Landing the first job is a milestone; continuous learning is paramount thereafter. </p>
